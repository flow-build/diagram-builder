### Submitting an Issue
Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize
the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.
Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with
quickly:

### Submitting a Pull Request
Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

- Search [GitHub](https://github.com/flow-build/diagram-builder/pulls) for an open or closed Pull Request
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo.
- [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your copy.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/diagram-builder.git -o flow-build-diagram-builder
cd flow-build-diagram-builder/
```

- After cloning, set a new remote [upstream](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) (this helps to keep your fork up to date)

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/flow-build/diagram-builder.git
```

- Make your changes in a new git branch:

```shell
git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
```

see [branch name pattern](https://github.com/flow-build/flow-build/wiki/Branch-Pattern) to help us for better identification.

- Create your patch and run appropriate tests.
- Follow our [Coding Format](#format).
- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that uses the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".

```shell
git commit -a
```

Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

- Push your branch to GitHub:

```shell
git push origin my-fix-branch
```

In GitHub, send a pull request to `diagram-builder:master`.
If we suggest changes, then:

- Make the required updates.
- Re-run flow-build/diagram-builder and make sure any and all tests are still passing.
- Commit your changes to your branch (e.g. `my-fix-branch`).
- Push the changes to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request).

If the PR gets too outdated we may ask you to rebase and force push to update the PR:

```shell
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git push origin my-fix-branch -f
```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

- Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

- Check out the master branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master -f
    ```

- Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

- Update your master with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream master
    ```

## Conventional commits

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) specification. Releasing to GitHub and NPM is done with the support of [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).

Pull requests should have a title that follows the specification, otherwise, merging is blocked. If you are not familiar with the specification simply ask maintainers to modify. You can also use this cheatsheet if you want:

- `fix: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is a bug fix and PATCH release must be triggered.
- `feat: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is a feature and MINOR release must be triggered.
- `docs: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to the documentation and there is no need to trigger release.
- `chore: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to cleanup in the project and there is no need to trigger release.
- `test: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to tests and there is no need to trigger release.
- `refactor: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to refactoring and there is no need to trigger release.

What about MAJOR release? just add `!` to the prefix, like `fix!: ` or `refactor!: `

Prefix that follows specification is not enough though. Remember that the title must be clear and descriptive with usage of [imperative mood](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative).

Happy contributing :heart:
